# CI/CD POC on Openshift

In this repo, we demonstrate a fully integrated CI/CD pipeline using a source code control system (Gogs), an artifact repository (Nexus3), and code analysis (SonarQube), and deployed to production in a blue-green strategy orchestrated by Jenkins.

## Install CI/CD componets
In this stage we setup infrastructure components that build up the CI/CD pipeline.

### Nexus


### Sonarqube


### Gogs
For copying the gogs configuration after setting it up:
```
oc cp $(oc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=gogs -o json | jq -r '.items[0].metadata.name'):/opt/gogs/custom/conf/app.ini app.ini
```
